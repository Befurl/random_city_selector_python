Selects a random city from the list of cities at https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities.

I plan on using this project to give myself a different city to research every day. This is a very basic implementation right now, and I may add graphics or further functionality later down the line. For now I just wanted something up and running so that I could get started trying to research different cities.
